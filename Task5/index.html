            <p>Most people think of frisbee as a casual form of relaxation between two people, or perhaps an alternative to throwing a stick for your dog to run and fetch. But apparently it can be a serious competitive sport, too, as I discovered when I wandered past two uniformed teams playing a "serious" game of frisbee on a grass field the size of a soccer field. (After uploading these photos, I was informed by a Twitter friend that they were playing "Ultimate Frisbee," which is played by competitive club teams in colleges across the country. Who knew?)

                True, the uniforms consisted merely of a colored shirt, to distinguish the yellow team from the blue team; there were no helmets, hats, knee pads, or other forms of protection. It wasn't needed, because there was little or no physical contact between the players; they merely tossed the frisbee to other members of their team as they raced from one end of the field to the other. <a href="#">USA Ultimate</a>

                But the frisbee players ignored all of this, and continued dashing to and fro. I snapped a few hundred images during the course of an hour, and ended up with this set of 30 "keepers" ..
